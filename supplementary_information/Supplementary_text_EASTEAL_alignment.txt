EASTEAL AND JERMIIN 2011 REFERENCE ALIGNMENT
We used publicly available PhyloTree (van Oven and Kayser, 2009) sequences to create a large (n=7,747) reference alignment with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) (Andrews et al., 1999) site numbering convention. Inclusion of rCRS in  the reference alignment ensures that site numbering conventions are maintained and verified as new sequences are added. We aligned sequences in batches of 50 using the L-INS-i version of MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013), then combined the batches, resolving inconsistent gap placements manually. rCRS site numbers were preserved by removing sites at which gaps were introduced in the rCRS during the alignment process.
